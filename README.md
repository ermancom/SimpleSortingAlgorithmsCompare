# SimpleSortingAlgorithmsCompare
This project includes comparing some sorting algorithims (Quick,Heap,Insertion,Selection,Merge,Bubble)
### Summarize of The Project
With this project I wanted to see some differences between sorting algorithms. In particularly, the sorting performance of the algorithms was what I was most curious about. To sum up , this is the project about comparing Quick, Merge, Heap, Selection, Insertion,Bubble sorting algorithms simply.

### What does this project do ?
1- It generates an array (arrayDic) for n elements (n=10, n=100, n=1000, n=10000, n=100000)                                                 
2- This array (arrayDic) is copied to sortings arrays that are the arrays had been organized for each sorting algorithms. (arrayDicQ, arrayDicM, arrayDicH, arrayDicS, arrayDicI, arrayDicB). So, all of the sorting algorithms will deal with same value set.             
3- Each sorting algorithms will sort according to (n=10, n=100, n=1000, n=10000, n=100000) and then the results will be written.           
4- All of the processes will be done five times.                                                                                           
5- And all of the results will be written.                                                                                                  
### Note:
Each tick in the ElapsedTicks value represents the time interval equal to 1 second divided by the Frequency.
